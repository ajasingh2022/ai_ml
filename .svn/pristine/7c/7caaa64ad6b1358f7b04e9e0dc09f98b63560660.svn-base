To get the Android Device Bridge Debugging working, a USB driver must first be installed.

However, on Windows 8.1 there appears to be a problem installing the Opticon driver that is 
included on the mounted USB drive that appears when you connect the Opticon H-27.

The solution is provided in the opticon users guide, but provided here in a modified working form:

1. Download the Google USB Driver from http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html#top 

2. Unzip to a known location

3. Enable USB debugging on H‐27 and connect it via USB to your PC

4. Open Device Manager

5. In Device Manager right click H‐27 and chose “Update driver…”

6. Select “Browse my computer for driver software”

7. Select “Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer”

8. Chose the row “Show all devices” and click “Next”

9. Select “Have disk…”

10. “Browse…” to the folder location of the unzipped ADB driver from Google and click “Open” and then “OK”

11. Click “Next”, chose “Android ADB Interface” and then click “Yes” in the dialog showing a warning message

12. Click ”Install” in the dialog box asking if you trust Google Inc

13. Verify H‐27 is now identified as an Android device in the Device Manager

14. Open a command prompt and go to your android-sdks platform-tools folder.

15. Type the following:
adb kill-server
echo 0x076c >> "%USERPROFILE%\.android\adb_usb.ini"
echo 0x16D5 >> "%USERPROFILE%\.android\adb_usb.ini"
adb devices

16. After typing adb devices the Android Device Bridge server should start again and show the opticon device.
